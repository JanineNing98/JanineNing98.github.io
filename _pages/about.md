My research interest is in Dimensionality Reduction, Machine Learning, Structure Learning, Deep Learning, Multi-view Learning, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Big Data, and Optimization. 

Before that, I received MPhil degree (2023) with [Prof. Jingjin Wu](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/Jingjinwu/en) and [Prof. Tiejun Tong](https://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~tongt/) in in [Probability and Mathematical Statistics](https://gs.uic.edu.cn/graduate1/Research_Postgraduate_Programme/Probability_and_Mathematical_Statistics.htm) and B.S. degree (2017) in Pharmaceutical Science from the School of Pharmaceutical Science at Peking University.

Before that, I received a Master of Philosophy degree in [Probability and Mathematical Statistics](https://gs.uic.edu.cn/graduate1/Research_Postgraduate_Programme/Probability_and_Mathematical_Statistics.htm) in 2023 through a jointly cultivated program between [UIC](https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/) and [HKBU](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jingjin Wu](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/Jingjinwu/en) and [Prof. Tiejun Tong](https://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~tongt/). What's more, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in [Financial Mathematics](https://fst.uic.edu.cn/fm_en/) from [BNU-HKBU United International College]((https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/) in 2020.
